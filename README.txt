Hello,

you will need an IDE to run the program. Open the project with GA Codes.

The source code is inside "GA Codes/src/GA.java"
The Executable or the main running program is "GA Codes/src/GA_Driver.java"

The paramater changing is really easy.

Open the GA_Driver and you will find a constructor, where all the parameters are given.

The file name of data set can be changed from this line of GA_Driver program, File fname = new File("Data1.txt"); // modify the string with the desired file name.

For each configuration of the algorithm for each data set, there is a graph and a summary statistics data, I never saved those data file but the graph is there.

However, I saved the best data file from each data set with two different algorithm configurations.

You will find the statistical data folder, where everything is located.

There are two folder that shows the comparison between the two point and uniform crossover for each of the data sets. You will also find 4 output data with
two_point_avg_fitness_elites and uniform_avg_fitness_elites and two_point_Average_fitness_population and uniform_average_fitness_populations for 
each of the data set 1 and 2.

On the next two folder, Data_1_T_Tests -> T_Tests results are provided in the text file T-Tests_Data1 and T-Tests_Data2 respectively.

Data1 Stats and Data 2 stats folder has all the summary statistics and best data of all the parameters are provided.

For statistics, python programs were used to generate graphs and summary stats. On each folder a python program is provided. Feel free to look at it if you want.
As well as, well commented.

There is one Final_Report attached to the assignment 2 folder. 

Thank you for your time.

Best Regards,
Hridoy Rahman
